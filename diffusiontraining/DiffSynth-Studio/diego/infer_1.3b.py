The dog has brownish-yellow fur, with both ears standing upright, and an expression thatâ€™s focused yet joyful. Sunlight shines on its body, making the fur look especially soft and glossy. The background is an open grassy field dotted with a few wildflowers, with faint blue sky and some white clouds in the distance. The perspective is clear, capturing the dynamic motion of the dog running and the vitality of the surrounding grass. Medium shot with a side-moving angle.",
